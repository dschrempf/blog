Sometimes you discover online resources that you want to remember and share.
[These tutorials](http://iptables.org/) by the developers of [`iptables`](http://iptables.org/) (mainly Paul 'Rusty' Russell)
are one of those gems. They discuss how the internet works, how packets can be
adequately filtered and how a firewall can be setup.

Enjoy!
