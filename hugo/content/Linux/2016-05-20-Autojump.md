**Autojump** is a `cd` command that learns!  It enables you to easily
navigate directories from the command line:

-   [Autojump on GitHub](https://github.com/wting/autojump)

It is readily available in most Linux distributions.  The sole thing
that has to be done manually is sourcing a script in your `.bashrc`.

```bash
source /etc/profile.d/autojump.sh
```

Jumping around with `j` is awesome :-)!
