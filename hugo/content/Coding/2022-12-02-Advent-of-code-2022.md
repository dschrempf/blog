[Everybody](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/11/30/advent-of-code-2022) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/z9mjcz/advent_of_code_2022_day_1/) [their](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33811958) [solutions](https://wjwh.eu/posts/2022-11-30-haskell-aoc-tricks.html) [in](https://gitlab.com/slotThe/advent2022) [Haskell](https://github.com/borisskert/Advent-of-Code-2022.hs) to the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) (described well
on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code)). So I thought I am going to join the crowd.

[**Here are mine**](https://github.com/dschrempf/advent-of-code-twentytwo)! I did clean the code after submission, but I did not change
anything substantial such as algorithms or data structures.

([Want](https://github.com/Scriptim/AdventOfCode2022) [some](https://github.com/hrichharms/AoC_2022) [more](https://github.com/Lorin-Lange/Advent-of-Code-2022)? [And](https://github.com/prikhi/advent-of-code-2022) --- [well](https://github.com/Sheinxy/Advent2022) --- [more](https://github.com/IndecisionTree/adventofcode2022)?)

If you ask me, the solutions of [Sheinxy](https://github.com/Sheinxy/Advent2022) and [Scriptim](https://github.com/Scriptim/AdventOfCode2022) are great! Also, do not
miss the ones posted by [Monday Morning Haskell](https://github.com/MondayMorningHaskell/AdventOfCode/tree/aoc-2022/src), although they do have some
boilerplate.
