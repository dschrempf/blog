_Alle Jahre wieder ..._

I am not sure how far I get this year, but writing Haskell is just too much fun.
Have a look at [my solutions to the Advent of code, 2023](https://github.com/dschrempf/aoc23).

Cheers!

PS: I even added automatic fetching of the full input as well as the samples
(see [Fetch.hs](https://github.com/dschrempf/aoc23/blob/main/app/Fetch.hs)). For example,

```sh
cabal run fetch 1    # Fetch full input of day one.
cabal run fetch 1 1  # Fetch sample one of day one.
```
