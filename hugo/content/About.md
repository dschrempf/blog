Postdoc in Computational Biology<br />
[Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest](https://www.elte.hu/en/)

**I am available for hire!**<br />
Please see below, [download my resume](/2022-11-09-CV-Schrempf-Dominik.pdf) and feel free to contact me!<br />

Interested? I built a proof of concept and stake web application: A [**minimalist
weather prediction application**](https://dschrempf.duckdns.org/). I deploy the application to my home server
which is turned on roughly from 8am to 10pm CET.

## About {#about}

I am a postdoctoral researcher and software engineer in computational biology
with 15 years of experience in programming in Haskell. I have applied my
programming skills in a wide array of topics ranging from physics and biology to
finance. Now, I would like to move fully into the programming community.

I consider myself an expert in developing, implementing and applying Markov
chain Monte Carlo samplers. I also have comprehensive experience in working with
probabilistic models and algorithms in maximum likelihood frameworks.

I have used Haskell extensively in my research projects involving statistical
inference on phylogenetic trees, which show evolutionary relationships of
species. In particular, one of my most successful projects is [`mcmc`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mcmc), a flexible
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler with state-of-the-art features (e.g.,
techniques based on Hamiltonian dynamics). I am using the `mcmc` library, for
example, to [estimate node ages of phylogenetic trees](https://github.com/dschrempf/mcmc-date) with great success.

Further, I am developing libraries and tools available on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/user/dschrempf). Working on
these libraries did not only require expertise in statistical methods but has
also trained me in other aspects of computer science such as efficient data
structures, serialization, parallel programming, unit and property testing, or
parsing. Further, I have gained experience in concurrent multithreaded
programming using Web Sockets and REST APIs by developing a trading bot.

I am also familiar with the Linux and Nix ecosystems. I have been using Linux
for over 20 years and NixOS for more than three years. I manage my projects
using Git and the Nix package manager.

Finally, I enjoy working in international teams. In the last ten years, English
has been my working language, and I have been collaborating with scientists from
all over the world. I have acquired considerable experience in giving oral
presentations, for example, by attending conferences. I am also proficient in
reading and writing publications (17 papers published in renowned scientific
journals; see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3pvnGAcAAAAJ&hl=en)).

I am enthusiastic about new projects and challenges, and about joining your
engineering team and contributing to your codebase. Haskell is my passion, but I
also frequently use other programming languages such as Rust or Python. I am
available for hire! Please [download my resume](/2022-11-09-CV-Schrempf-Dominik.pdf), have a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/dschrempf) profile
and feel free to contact me!
