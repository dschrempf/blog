<2023-02-27 Mon> Note: I have taken the application offline.

I created a minimalist [[https://dschrempf.duckdns.org/][weather predicition application]] --- a short proof of
concept and stake.

The main elements of the Haskell tech stack are:
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty][Scotty]]: A web framework.
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid][Lucid]]: A domain specific language for HTML.
- [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mcmc][Mcmc]]: A Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler.

Other noteworthy components of this project:
- The development environment is managed by the [[https://github.com/NixOS/nix][Nix package manager]].
- The application is deployed using a [[https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html][Nix Flake]].

For details, have a look at the [[https://github.com/dschrempf/webapp][project source code]].

I deploy the application to my home server which is turned on roughly from 8am
to 10pm CET. I mean, who wants to predict the weather during the night?
