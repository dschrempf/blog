#+TITLE: Easy pretty print in Haskell

#+DESCRIPTION: Use pretty-show to pretty print objects in GHCi.
#+KEYWORDS: Haskell "Pretty Print" Show
#+LANGUAGE: en

I repeatedly struggle with GHCi when I want to print lists and maps and actually
look at them and analyze them. Today I came accross [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pretty-show][pretty-show]], a haskell
package that allows pretty printing of all objects that are instances of the
type class Show.

The usage is very straight forward:

#+begin_src haskell
import qualified Text.Show.Pretty as Pr
#+end_src

This provides Pr.ppShow which can be used in GHCi (or other interpreters):
#+begin_src haskell
putStrLn $ Pr.ppShow object
#+end_src
