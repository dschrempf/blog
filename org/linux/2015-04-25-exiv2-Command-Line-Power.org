Does this sound familiar to you: You come back from a holiday with your family
or friends and want to merge photos taken with 4 different cameras. However,
somebody forgot to adjust the date (or did not set the daylight saving time
accordingly). Hmm.

This problem can be solved easily.  =exiv2= is a program to read and
write Exif image metadata and image comments.  It offers a very easy
command line interface and shortcuts to batch rename files (e.g., by
time and date) or to change Exif flags.

The [[http://www.exiv2.org/][=exiv2= homepage]].

* Examples from the manual
Some examples from the manual (=man exiv2=):
- =exiv2 *.jpg= :: Prints a summary of the Exif information for all
     JPEG files in the directory.
- =exiv2 rename img_1234.jpg= :: Renames ~img_1234.jpg~ (taken on
     13-Nov-05 at 22:58:31) to ~20051113_225831.jpg~.
- =exiv2 -r':basename:_%Y%m' rename img_1234.jpg= :: Renames
     ~img_1234.jpg~ to ~img_1234_200511.jpg~.
- =exiv2 -et img1.jpg img2.jpg= :: Extracts the Exif thumbnails from
     the two files into ~img1-thumb.jpg~ and ~img2-thumb.jpg~.

* Adjust date and time
We use the adjust switch from above:
- ad | adjust :: Adjust Exif time stamps by the given time.  Time
     adjustment is in the format =[-]HH[:MM[:SS]]=.  Examples: =1=
     adds one hour, =1:01= adds one hour and one minute, =-0:00:30=
     subtracts 30 seconds.
An example:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
exiv2 adjust -a 1 *.jpg
#+END_SRC
adds one hour to the time stamp of all JPG files in the working
directory.

* Batch rename
After you have adjusted the time stamps of the different cameras, you
may want to rename the files, e.g.:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
exiv2 rename *.jpg
#+END_SRC
renames all JPG files in the working directory to ~date_time.jpg~,
something very useful.
