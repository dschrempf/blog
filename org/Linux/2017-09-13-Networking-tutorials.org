Sometimes you discover online resources that you want to remember and share.
[[https://www.netfilter.org/documentation/index.html#documentation-howto][These tutorials]] by the developers of [[http://iptables.org/][=iptables=]] (mainly Paul 'Rusty' Russell)
are one of those gems. They discuss how the internet works, how packets can be
adequately filtered and how a firewall can be setup.

Enjoy!
