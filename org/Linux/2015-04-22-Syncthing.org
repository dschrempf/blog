* Introduction
Recently, I have explained how to configure [[file:2015-01-30-BTSync.org][BitTorrent Sync over an SSH SOCKS
proxy]]. However, due to various problems with BTSync, I tried Syncthing and I am
very satisfied with it.

Advantages that I have experienced so far:
- open source;
- publicly available synchronization protocol;
- very reliable if the configuration is fine;
- it's a young project with motivated developers;
- it is fast (if enough CPU is available).

Disadvantages that I have experienced so far:
- needs more CPU (this is an issue if you are using devices with very
  old or slow hardware, e.g., a Raspberry Pi);
- the configuration is more tedious.

The general setup is very well explained on the project homepages:
- https://syncthing.net/ and
- https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing.

However, I have the problem, that my computer at work (~clientA~) is
behind a firewall and not exposed to the public.  In order to
circumvent the firewall, we need a ~clientB~ that has full internet
access, runs an SSH server and is accessible by ~clientA~; then we can
set up SSH such that it forwards connection requests from =clientA= to
the outside and the other way around; check it out.

* The idea
We will use SSH port forwarding to map a port on ~clientA~ (let it be
port 22111) to a port on the NAT router at ~my.router.hostname~ (here
I will use port 22222).  The router has to redirect the port to the
~clientC~ that listens for incoming connections at this specific port
with Syncthing (port 20000 here).

In more detail, after the configuration below, the port
~localhost:22111~ on ~clientA~ will point to a random port on
~clientB~.  There, the SSH server redirects the traffic to another
random outgoing port and forwards it to ~my.router.hostname:22222~.
You still need to setup your router so that it forwards incoming
connections to ~clientC:20000~ (many router port forwarding tutorials
are available online).

This way, we can circumvent the firewall that prevents direct access
to ~my.router.hostname:22222~.

* The setup
In order for this to work, you need SSH access from ~clientA~ to
~clientB~ (let's assume that your user name is ~user~).  ~clientB~
needs to run an SSH server and have full access to the internet.

The forwarding from ~clientA~ to the router at ~my.router.hostname~
is done by the following SSH command:
: ssh -N -vvv -L 22111:my.router.hostname:22222 user@clientB
- ~-N~ :: Do not open an interactive session (no commands can be
     entered at prompt).
- ~-vvv~ :: Increase verbosity to a high level, so that you can debug
     problems if you have any (can be removed later).
- ~-L~ :: This tells SSH to use the SSH server at ~clientB~ to map the
     local (~-L~) port 22111 on the client that runs the SSH command
     (in this case ~clientA~) to port 22222 on ~my.router.hostname~.
     Hence, if ~localhost:22111~ is accessed at ~clientA~, it gets
     forwarded to the NAT router which in turn has to be set up to
     forward incoming requests at port number 22222 to , e.g.,
     ~clientC:22000~.

It is important to notice that the forwarding specification (for both,
local and remote forwards) consists of 3 parts ~p1:host:p2~.  ~p1~ is
the port on the client that executes the SSH command; ~host~ is the
host seen from the SSH server (e.g., ~clientB~) and not from the
client executing the command; ~p2~ is the port on ~host~ seen from the
SSH server.  I.e., =ssh -L 123:localhost:456 ssh_server= forwards port
123 on the client executing the SSH command to port 456 on
~ssh_server~.

* Test the setup
The setup can be tested very easily and efficiently with the following
method (this method can also be used with other software or ports).
1. Close all running Syncthing processes on both sides.
2. Tell ~clientC~ to listen on port 22000 by running =nc -l -p 22000= on ~clientC~.
3. Access port 22111 on ~clientA~ by running =nc -v localhost 22111=
   on ~clientA~.
4. Type some stuff into the terminal at ~clientA~ and hope that it is
   printed at ~clientC~.

If everything works, you can remove the ~-vvv~ flag, add a ~-q~ flag
which tells SSH to be quiet and run the SSH port forwarding at boot.
: ssh -N -q -L 22111:my.router.hostname:22222 user@clientB

A good [[http://blog.trackets.com/2014/05/17/ssh-tunnel-local-and-remote-port-forwarding-explained-with-examples.html][blog article about port forwarding]].

Furthermore, the port forwarding has to be started before Syncthing
starts, otherwise there be dragons.  I have written a small script
that waits some time to start the port forwarding as well as a script
that does the same for ~syncthing.service~ and
~syncthing-inotify.service~.

* Remote port forwarding
Furthermore, if you want to reach ~clientA~ from home, remote port
forwarding can also be done.  However, I did not need this and did not
follow it up, e.g.:
: ssh -N -q -R 22000:localhost:22200 clientB
This would tell ~clientB~ to forward incoming requests at port 22200
to the client that executes the SSH command; in this case,
~clientA~.  Take care, ~GatewayPorts~ has to be set to ~yes~.

* Amazing stuff
Something to think about: Assume a working SSH server on ~clientC~
that is accessible by ~clientA~ (maybe only via ~clientB~).  Suppose,
that the IP address of the router is ~192.168.1.1~ (seen from
~clientC~; local area network).  What does the following command
(executed on ~clientA~) achieve?
: ssh -L 12345:192.168.1.1:80 clientC
Try to access ~localhost:12345~ in your browser at ~clientA~ and watch
the pure awesomeness!
