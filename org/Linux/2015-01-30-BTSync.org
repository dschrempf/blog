#+TITLE: BitTorrent Sync over SSH proxy

#+DESCRIPTION: Use BitTorrent Sync over an SSH SOCKS Proxy
#+KEYWORDS: BTSync, BitTorrent, Sync, SOCKS, Proxy, SSH
#+LANGUAGE: en

<2015-04-22 Wed> I have switched from BitTorrent Sync to [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]].
Reasons are:
- the synchronization was not reliable (synchronization stalled
  sometimes; every update leads to a re-synchronization of all files);
- the corporate policy is not to my liking (a Pro version is
  available; the free version only supports a limited amount of
  folders and clients; it is not sure if it will stay free in the
  future).
Please also refer to the blog entry that describes how to configure
[[file:2015-04-22-Syncthing.org][Syncthing with SSH port forwarding]].

* Introduction
<2015-01-30 Fri> [[http://www.getsync.com/][BitTorrent Sync]] is a nice program that lets you sync
two clients using advanced peer-to-peer technology.  It can be a very
good replacement for Dropbox if you do not want to share files with
others (although you could still use Dropbox for file sharing with
others).  Especially so, because it does not save any of your data on
a server and synchronization is encrypted.  Furthermore, it can be
installed very easily on Linux (and even on a Mac and on Windows).
Please see the installation instructions on their homepage.

The problem I had is that one of my clients (say client A) is behind a
firewall.  In order to circumvent it, we need a client B that has full
access to the internet and that is accessible by client A; then we ca
set up an SSH SOCKS proxy; check it out.

* Setup of SSH tunnel
In order for this to work, you need SSH access from client A to client
B.  Client B needs to have access to the internet.  Then you can setup
a dynamic SSH tunnel at client A with:
#+begin_src sh
  ssh -vvv -N -D 1080 username@clientB
#+end_src
- ~-vvv~ :: Increase verbosity to a high level, so that you can debug
     problems if you have any (can be removed later).
- ~-N~ :: Do not open an interactive session (no commands can be
     entered at prompt).
- ~-D 1080~ :: Dynamically forward all requests to ~localhost:1080~ to
     client B (act as a SOCKS proxy on port 1080; if you are
     interested please see, e.g., [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding][port forwarding]]).

If this worked out, every process on client A that accesses
~localhost:1080~ will be forwarded to client B that is outside the
firewall.  I.e., you could also tell Firefox to use this SOCKS proxy
so that you can access sites that you cannot otherwise.  Actually this
is a very good idea to test if the SOCKS proxy works in general.

* BTSync setup
Now, BTSync should automatically find this SOCKS proxy (because it is
using the standard port 1080; my BTSync version is ~1.4.106~) and uses
it to circumvent the firewall.  The very good and informative debug
output of the SSH tunnel can be used to identify possible problems.  A
sample configuration file looks like this:

<2015-04-01 Wed> The automatic detection of the SOCKS proxy did not
work anymore (BTSync version ~2.0.93~).  I have adjusted the
configuration file below.
