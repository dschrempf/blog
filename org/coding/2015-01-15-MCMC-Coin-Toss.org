#+DESCRIPTION: MCMC simulation to approximate observations of coin tosses.
#+KEYWORDS: MCMC Simulation "Bayesian Statistics" "Coin Toss"

Suppose we observe 58 heads out of 100 coin tosses. Now, we want to know the
probability of tossing a head $\theta$. A maximum likelihood guess would be
$\theta = 0.58$ because then, the probability of observing 58 heads
\begin{align}
  P(58 \mathrm{ heads}) = {100 \choose 58} (0.58)^{58} (0.42)^{42}
\end{align}
is greatest (an example of the binomial distribution).

However, we could also use a Bayesian approach to calculate the posterior
distribution of the probability $\theta$ (i.e., the probability that $\theta$ is
a certain value conditioned on our observation).

The following C++ code does exactly this (the last column is the posterior).
